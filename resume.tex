    {Team Lead}
    {November 2015 -- Present}
    {\bodytext{Supervised two other full-time software engineers on the back-end team, working with the Product team to prioritize and groom new features. 

Managed a summer intern (planned a summer project, lead the hiring process, supervised the project) integrating multiple external services (SalesForce, Shopify, GitHub, etc) with our own internal services.

Architected our transition to Kubernetes (from a hand-managed Ansible/Docker setup) and expanded our use of PostgreSQL.}}

  \headedsubsection
    {Sr Software Engineer}
    {June 2014 -- November 2015}
    {\bodytext{Architected and authored most of the server-side services and infrastructure. The WHOOP client apps send frequent bursts of biometric data for near-real-time analysis and send and receive metadata describing users' daily activity and performance. The server is composed of several in-house services (REST server, real-time data processing, slower data processing, time-based actions, etc) and several AWS services (Kinesis, SQS, SNS, RDS PostgreSQL). My work has primarily been in Python, Erlang, and JavaScript.\\

Some major technology choices I made: creating a suite of end-to-end tests, discarding Chef as a configuration management system, introducing Docker, introducing Erlang, replacing OpenTSDB with PostgreSQL, introducing Amazon Kinesis.}}

    {\bodytext{Enhanced Highfleet's deductive database system: wrote builtin functions for the logic programming language, improved communication with SQL-based back-ends, debugged query plans, helped write a new ANTLR-based language parser. Part of a very small development team, extremely self- motivated; most weeks consisted of coming up with appropriate enhancement or debugging tasks and then executing those.
    
Primary technical contact for customers: wrote custom GUIs on demand for customers, wrote internal tools to support ontologists, communicated extensively with customers. Sold a key customer a 50\% increase in their contract, then produced software to fulfill the new requirements.}}
